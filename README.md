# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 

I created three webpages that are linked together that show what I have done and what my interests are. 

By using bootstrap I have made the pictures and pages auto adjust when the screen size is minimized or maximized.

I have used rows and columns to display all items on all web pages.
